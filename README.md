## Hi there 👋, I am John Muinde

## About Me
I hold an MSc in Data Science from Strathmore University, and I am committed to the art of developing end-to-end data-driven solutions. 
My interests lie in data science, data engineering, and AI engineering. I have also recently fallen in love with working out after data -
Insights from my daily schedules indicated that I spent more than 80% of my time seated in front of a desk


- 🔭 I’m currently working on building an AI powered micro-investment platform for low income earners.
- 🌱 I’m currently improving my skills in AI engineering. 
- 👯 I’m looking to collaborate on any data science, data engneering and AI engneering projects. 
- ⚡ Fun fact: On a "good" day, I can bench 100kgs 😄.
